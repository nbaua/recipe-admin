This is a NextJS based react web application.

## How to get started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:<portnumber>] with your browser to see the result.

You can check .env file for the port number configuration, it is usually 3000, however you can customize the same.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:<portnumber>/api/<endpoint>] can be accessed via and edited using `pages/api/<endpoint>.js`.

This works as the `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. 
Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
